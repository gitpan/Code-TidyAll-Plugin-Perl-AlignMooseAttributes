NAME
    Code::TidyAll::Plugin::Perl::AlignMooseAttributes - Sort and align
    Moose-style attributes with tidyall

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Code::TidyAll::Plugin::Perl::AlignMooseAttributes;

DESCRIPTION
    This tidyall plugin sorts and aligns consecutive Moose-style attribute
    lines. e.g. this:

        has 'namespace' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', default => 'Default' );
        has 'expires_at' => ( is => 'rw', default => CHI_Max_Time );
        has 'storage' => ( is => 'ro' );
        has 'label' => ( is => 'rw', lazy_build => 1 );
        has 'chi_root_class' => ( is => 'ro' );

    becomes this:

        has 'chi_root_class' => ( is => 'ro' );
        has 'expires_at'     => ( is => 'rw', default => CHI_Max_Time );
        has 'label'          => ( is => 'rw', lazy_build => 1 );
        has 'namespace'      => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', default => 'Default' );
        has 'storage'        => ( is => 'ro' );

    Only consecutive attributes, each on a single line, will be affected.
    Multi-line attributes will not be affected.

    This plugin has a preprocess step that hides these lines to prevent
    perltidy from splitting them into multiple lines.
